But if you are a student in during one of our remunared workshop.
A key claim will be given to you.

We don't have yet  a system for that.
But I could in the future use Ethereum to check the credit your address send to the Integer Games Wallet.


### What can I do with my Key ?

The key allows you to do remote control with a little bit of code or community interface.

If you have a key but you are not subscriber, you can do action with it but not enough to play. 
Just enough for small Iot project and home remote control like project.
